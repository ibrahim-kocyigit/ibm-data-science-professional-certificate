    "**Database** is a program that stores data and provides functionalities for adding, modifying, and querying that data. Databases help keep data secure, organized, and easily accessible.\n",

    "`SELECT` statement is the primary command in SQL. It's used to retrieve data from a database table. It's a Database Manipulation Language (DML) statement that allows you to specify which columns and rows you want to retrieve.\n",

    "A Database Management System (DBMS) not only stores data but also provides tools for retrieving and manipulating that data. The `SELECT` statement is a key tool for data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `SELECT` statement is often called a **query**, and the output it produces is called a **result set** or **result table**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic Syntax\n",
    "* `SELECT * FROM table_name`: Retrieves all columns and all rows from the specified table.\n",
    "* `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name`: Retrieves only the specified columns from the table.\n",

    "\n",
    "`DISTINCT` is used to remove duplicate values from a result set, returning only unique values.  For example, `SELECT DISTINCT country FROM customers` retrieves a list of unique countries from the \"country\" column of the \"customers\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned by a query, which is useful for previewing data or working with large datasets. For example, `SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10` retrieves the first 10 rows from the \"products\" table. If we use `SELECT * FROM FilmLocations LIMIT 15 OFFSET 10;` the results start from row 11, leaving the first 10 row aside."

    "**Relational Model and Data Independence:** The relational model is widely used for databases because it provides data independence. This means that the way data is stored and accessed is independent of the way it is used by applications. This offers flexibility and easier maintenance.\n",

    "* **Entities:** Represent real-world objects or concepts (e.g., book, author, borrower). In an ER diagram, they are represented as triangles.\n",

    "**Mapping Entities and Attributes to Tables and Columns:**  \n",
    "In a relational database, entities become tables, and attributes become columns within those tables.\n",
