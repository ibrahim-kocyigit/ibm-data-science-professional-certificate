# WHAT IS DATA SCIENCE

# Defining Data Science and What Data Scientists Do

## Defining Data Science
Data science is the art of uncovering the insights and trends hidden within data to understand the world around us. While data analysis itself isn't new, recent advancements in data access and computing power have revolutionized our ability to extract knowledge and drive innovation.

## What Do Data Scientists Do?
Similar to detectives uncovering secrets or scientists exploring the natural world, data scientists use a methodical approach to glean insights from data:

* Clarify the Problem: Define the question or problem you're trying to solve with data.
* Data Collection: Gather relevant data from various sources.
* Analysis: Apply statistical and computational techniques to analyze the data.
* Pattern Recognition: Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.
* Storytelling: Translate the data insights into a compelling narrative.
* Visualization: Create visual representations of the data and insights.

### Essential Skills for Data Scientists
Beyond technical expertise in statistics and programming, successful data scientists possess:

* Curiosity: To explore data and ask meaningful questions.
* Argumentation: To effectively communicate findings and persuade others.
* Judgment: To guide the analysis process and make informed decisions.

### The Evolving Role of the Data Scientist
Companies seek versatile data scientists with:

* Domain Expertise: Deep knowledge in a specific field.
* Analytical Skills: Proficiency in data analysis and programming.
* Communication Skills: Ability to clearly convey insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Data scientists often have diverse backgrounds in fields like economics, engineering, and medicine. 

As technology evolves, so too will the role of the data scientist. Continuous learning and adaptation are essential for success in this dynamic field.

## Big Data and Data Mining

In the 'Big Data and Data Mining' lesson, delve into the world of digital transformation driven by Big Data. Explore Cloud Computing's role, foundational Big Data concepts, tools like Hadoop and Spark, and gain insights into Data Mining techniques for informed decision-making.

### How Big Data is Driving Digital Transformation

* Digital transformation is driven by data science, especially Big Data, leading to fundamental changes in how organizations operate and deliver value.
* Big Data analysis provides a competitive advantage and has led to transformations across industries (e.g., Netflix, Houston Rockets, Lufthansa).
* Digital transformation involves in-depth analysis to improve processes, not just digitizing existing ones. 
* Organizations must adapt their approach to data, employees, and customers, leading to cultural shifts.
* Successful transformation requires support from top-level executives (CEO, CIO, CDO) and organization-wide buy-in.
* Digital transformation necessitates a new mindset and is crucial for success in the current and future business landscape.

### Introduction to Cloud

* **Cloud computing** delivers on-demand computing resources (servers, storage, etc.) over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis.
* **Five essential characteristics of cloud computing** are:    
    * **On-demand self service:** Users can access resources as needed without requiring human interaction with the provider.
    * **Broad network access:** Resources are accessible over the network through various devices (phones, laptops, etc.).
    * **Resource pooling:** Provider's resources are pooled to serve multiple clients, offering cost efficiency.
    * **Rapid elasticity:** Resources can be scaled up or down quickly based on demand.
    * **Measured service:** Pay-as-you-go model where users are charged only for the resources they consume.
* **Three cloud deployment models** are:    
    * Public cloud (shared resources over the internet)
    * Private cloud (exclusive use by a single organization)
    * Hybrid cloud (mix of public and private)
* **Three cloud service models** are:  
    * **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Access to infrastructure (servers, storage) without managing it.
    * **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Access to a platform for developing and deploying applications.
    * **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Access to software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.

### Cloud for Data Science
**Cloud computing for Data Science** allows for centralized data storage and access to advanced computing resources, bypassing local limitations.

**Benefits:**  
* Store and process large datasets.
* Access advanced algorithms and high-performance computing.
* Enables collaboration by allowing multiple users to work with the same data simultenaously.
* Provides access to open-source tools (like Apache Spark) without local installation.
* Offers access to the latest tools and libraries.
* Accessible from anywhere and anytime, faciliating collaboration.

### Foundations of Big Data
**Big Data** refers to the massive and diverse volumes of data generated by people, tools, and machines. It requires new technologies to process and extract meaningful insights.

**The 5 V's of Big Data**  
* **Velocity:** The speed at which data is generated and accumulates.
* **Volume:** The scale or amount of data.
* **Variety:** The different types and sources of data (structured and unstructured)
* **Veracity:** The quality, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data.
* **Value:** The ability to extract meaningful insights and benefits from data.

**Challenges of Big Data** is that it requires new tools and techniques to analyze due to its volume and variety.

**Tools for Big Data analysis** include Apache Spark, and Hadoop ecosystem.

**Benefits of Big Data**: Provides insights for organizations to connect with customers and improve services.
