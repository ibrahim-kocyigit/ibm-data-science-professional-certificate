**Algorithm**:  
A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem or complete a task. _(0101)_

**Comma-separated values (CSV) / Tab-separated values (TSv)**:  
Commonly used format for storing tabular data as plain text where either the comma or the tab separates each value. _(0101)_

**Data file types**:  
A computer file configuration is desired to store data in a specific way. _(0101)_

**Data format**:  
How data is encoded so it can be stored within a data file type. _(0101)_

**Data visualization**:  
A visual way, such as a graph, of representing data in a readily understandable way. Makes it easier to see trends in the data. _(0101)_

**Delimited text file**:  
A plain text file where a specific character separates the data values. _(0101)_

**Extensible Markup Language (XML)**:  
A language designed to structure, store, and enable data exchange between various technologies. _(0101)_

**Hadoop**:  
An open-source framework designed to store and process large datasets across clusters of computers. _(0101)_

**JavaScript Object Notation**:  
A data format compatible with various programming languages for two applications to exchange structured data. _(0101)_

**Jupyter notebooks**:  
A computational environment that allows users to create and share documents containing code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. See "Python notebooks". _(0101)_

**Model**:  
A representation of the relationships and patterns found in data to make predictions or analyze complex systems retaining essential elements needed for analysis. _(0101)_

**Nearest neighbor**:  
A machine learning algorithm that predicts a target variable based on its similarity to other values in the dataset. _(0101)_

**Neural networks**:  
A computational model used in deep learning that mimics the structure and functioning of the human brain's neural pathways. It takes an input, processes it using previous learning, and produces an output. _(0101)_

**Outliers**:  
When a data point or points occur significantly outside of most of the other data in a data set, potentially indicating anomalies, errors, or unique phenomena that could impact statistical analysis or modelling. _(0101)_

**Pandas**:  
An open-source Python library that provides tools for working with structured data. Is often used for data manipulation and analysis. _(0101)_

**Python notebooks**:  
Also known as Jupyter notebook, this computational environment allows users to create and share documents containing code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. _(0101)_

**Quantitative analysis**:  
A systematic approach using mathematical and statistical analysis is used to interpret numerical data. _(0101)_

**R:**  
An open-source programming language used for statistical computing, data analysis, and data visualization.

**Structured data**:  
Data is organized and formatted into a predictable schema, usually related tables with rows and columns. _(0101)_

**Unstructured data**:  
Unorganized data that lacks a predefined data model or organization makes it harder to analyze using traditional methods. This data type often includes text, images, videos, and other content that doesn't fit neatly into rows and columns like structured data. _(0101)_
