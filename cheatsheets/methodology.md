# Stages of Data Science Methodology


Buna göre elden geçir:
#### Data Science Methodology Framework:
1. Understand the problem
2. Select an analytical approach
3. Obtain, understand, prepare, and model the data.




### 1. Business Understanding:
_"What is the problem that I am trying to solve?"_

1. **Define:** Clearly defining the question is vital as it guides the analytic approach.
2. **Understand:** Understanding the goal of the person asking the question is crucial in establishing a clearly defined question.
3. **Objectives:** Objectives that support the goal should be identified to prioritize and plan for problem-solving.
4. **Engagement:** Engagement of different stakeholders is vital to determine requirements and clarify question.


### 2. Analytic Approach:
_"How can I use data to answer the question?"_

1. **Pattern:** Identifying what type of patterns will be needed to address the question most effectively. 
2. **Approach:** Different types of patterns and relationships in data require different approaches to effectively address the questions being asked.
3. **Question Types:** 
    * Descriptive: Current Status
    * Diagnostic: Statistical Analysis
    * Predictive: Forecasting
    * Prescriptive: Recommendations
4. **Machine Learning:** ML enables computers to learn without explicit programming and identify patterns in data that might otherwise not be accessible.


### 3. Data Requirements and Collection:
_"What data do I need, where is the data located, and how will I get it?_
1. **Data Requirements:** Initial data collection assessed for requirement fulfillment. Review requirements based on availability, quality, and content.
2. **Data Collection:** Requires knowing the source or where to find needed data elements, data acquisition strategies and deferred decisions on unavailable data.
3. **Data Integration:** DBAs / programmers extract, merge data from diverse sources. Eliminate redundant data, prep for data understanding. Automate database processes for efficiency and speed.
4. **Data Understanding:** Use statistics and visualization for data assessment. Identify data gaps, plan missing data to be filled or substituted. Prepare data for next analysis strategies.


### Data Understanding:
_"Does the data represent the problem accurately?"_

1. **Importance of Understanding:** Data understanding assesses the quality and significance ot data components. Uses visualizations and descriptive statistics.
2. **Assessment and Iteration:** Iterations refine both problem definition and collection methods.

### Data Preparation:
_"What additional work (preprocessing) is needed to manipulate and work with the data?"_

1. **

### Modeling:
_"When I apply data visualizations, do I see answers that address the business problem?"_

### Evaluation:
_"Does the model answer the business question or must I adjust the data?"_

### Model Deployment:
_"Can I put the model into practice?"_

### Feedback:
_"Can I get constructive feedback from the data and the stakeholder to answer the business question?"_
